Msg Shuming to add you as a contributor.

Before you start working on the project, `git pull`

If you suspect you're making a critical change, first create a new branch. `git checkout -b <name>`
Then push the changes of that branch. `git push origin <name>`
And log unto github to submit a Pull Request to merge your branch with master.
